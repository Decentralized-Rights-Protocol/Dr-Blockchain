## Project Vision *(≤256 characters)*  
**Decentralized Rights Protocol:** AI‑powered blockchain uniting human‑rights verification with sustainable development. Proof of Status + Proof of Activity consensus ensures fair, ethical governance for UN SDG acceleration.  

---  

## Problem Statement  
- Traditional blockchains ignore human‑rights considerations.  
- Proof‑of‑Work (PoW) wastes energy; Proof‑of‑Stake (PoS) entrenches wealth inequality.  
- No mechanism to verify real‑world human activities on‑chain.  
- Absence of ethical AI governance frameworks.  
- Humanitarian needs remain unaddressed by existing crypto solutions.  

---  

## Our Solution  
- **Dual‑consensus:**  
  - **PoST** (Proof of Status) validates identity & credentials.  
  - **PoAT** (Proof of Activity) records verified real‑world actions.  
- **AI Elder Quorum** – a decentralized AI council that enforces ethical policies and mitigates bias.  
- **Post‑quantum security** via lattice‑based cryptography and BLS threshold signatures with MPC.  
- **Dual‑token economics:**  
  - **$RIGHTS** – governance & voting power.  
  - **$DeRi** – utility for activity fees, rewards, and SDG‑linked incentives.  
- **UN SDG‑aligned use cases** built into the protocol’s incentive layer.

## Technical Innovation  
| Innovation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **BLS Threshold Signatures + MPC** | Enables fast, trust‑less multi‑party validation and post‑quantum resilience. |
| **Hybrid Storage** | Combines ScyllaDB (high‑throughput), OrbitDB (CRDT‑based decentralised DB), and IPFS (content‑addressable immutable storage). |
| **QUIC Networking** | Low‑latency, connection‑migration‑friendly transport for global node communication. |
| **AI Bias Detection & Mitigation** | Real‑time monitoring of model outputs; corrective feedback loops integrated into the Elder Quorum. |
| **Zero‑Trust Architecture** | End‑to‑end encryption, attestation of node integrity, and continuous verification of all inputs/outputs. |

## Impact & Use Cases  
- **Education Credentialing:** Verifiable diplomas & micro‑certifications.  
- **Sustainable Agriculture Tracking:** Transparent supply‑chain data for climate‑smart farming.  
- **Clean Energy Rewards:** Token incentives for renewable generation & consumption.  
- **Healthcare Verification:** Secure patient records & provenance of medical supplies.  
- **Humanitarian Aid Transparency:** Traceable fund distribution & impact reporting.  

---  

## Demo Highlights  
- **Ghana Pilot:** 500+ active users, community‑driven verification of agricultural outputs.  
- **Block Finality:** 1.8 seconds average across 12 geographically distributed validators.  
- **AI Bias Detection:** 99.2 % accuracy in identifying and correcting biased decisions.  
- **Activity Throughput:** 8.5 K PoAT submissions per day with sub‑second processing.  

---  

## What’s Next  
- **Geographic Expansion:** Launch pilots in Kenya & Brazil (Q1 2025).  
- **Mobile App:** Cross‑platform wallet & activity submission UI (iOS/Android).  
- **Cross‑Chain Integration:** Bridges to Ethereum, Polkadot, and Cosmos for asset interoperability.  
- **Growth Target:** Reach 1 M verified users and 10 M daily PoAT submissions by end‑2025.  

---  

## Team & Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python, Rust, Node.js  
- **AI/ML Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch  
- **Blockchain Core:** Custom dual‑consensus (PoST + PoAT) with BLS‑MPC.  
- **Storage Layers:** ScyllaDB (hot data), OrbitDB (CRDT sync), IPFS (immutable archives).  
- **Networking:** QUIC + libp2p for peer discovery and transport.
