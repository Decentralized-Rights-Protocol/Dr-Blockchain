## 🌍 DRP – Decentralized Rights Protocol

**DRP (Decentralized Rights Protocol)** is a next-generation blockchain protocol designed to safeguard **human rights**, build **global trust**, and accelerate the **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.

Unlike traditional blockchains focused only on finance, DRP introduces **AI-verified Proof of Status (PoS)** and **Proof of Activities (PoA)** — consensus mechanisms that reward **human effort, fairness, and sustainability**.

---

## ✨ Key Features

* 🔒 **AI-Verified Consensus**
  Proof of Status & Proof of Activities ensure trust by verifying real human effort with AI.

* ♻️ **Sustainability-First Design**
  Rewards participants for using clean energy and sustainable resources.

* 🛡 **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**
  Built with NIST-approved CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium algorithms for future-proof security against quantum attacks.

* 🤖 **AI Elders (Project Lazarus)**
  Cross-chain AI agents that ethically recover lost or abandoned digital assets.

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Human Rights-Centered Governance**
  Dual-token model:

  * `$RIGHTS` → Governance & voting
  * `$DeRi` → Utility & rewards

---

## 🏗 Current Status

✅ **Testnet (Python Implementation)**

* Core consensus in Python (for prototyping)
* Basic P2P networking
* Cryptographic primitives (hashing, signing)
* AI verification stubs

🚀 **Planned Mainnet (C++ + AI Modules)**

* High-performance C++ core
* Advanced cryptography (quantum resistance) ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
* Full AI-driven verification system
* Modular blockchain architecture

🔒 **Post-Quantum Security (IMPLEMENTED)**

* CRYSTALS-Kyber for quantum-resistant key exchange
* CRYSTALS-Dilithium for quantum-safe digital signatures
* Elder quorum integration with post-quantum consensus
* Secure key management with rotation and revocation

## 🌟 Vision

DRP is more than a blockchain.
It’s a **global protocol for fairness, sustainability, and human dignity**.

Together, we can build a system where:

* Healthcare, education, and clean water are fundamental rights.
* Effort and good actions are **verifiably rewarded**.
* Technology protects, rather than exploits, humanity.
