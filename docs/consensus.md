# 🔗 DRP Consensus Design Documentation  

## Implementation status (repository code)

The design below describes intended DRP consensus goals, not guarantees provided by
the current executable implementation. The current `src/core/protocol/consensus/bls_threshold.py`
module is a development quorum prototype using individual Ed25519 signatures.
Despite its historical name, it does **not** implement BLS aggregation, distributed
key generation, leader election, view changes, or production-grade BFT.

The prototype verifies signed proposals and positive votes, prevents a validator
from voting twice in the same round, and produces a certificate containing
individually verifiable signatures. Its default keys are generated in-process for
local simulation; production deployment requires independently provisioned keys,
persistent validator identity, authenticated peer transport, durable round state,
and adversarial/network-partition testing. Do not use this prototype to secure
real assets or claim production finality.

## 1. Overview  
The **Decentralized Rights Protocol (DRP)** introduces a new consensus mechanism that fuses:  
- **Proof of Status (PoST):** Validates *who* you are (identity, credentials, rights).  
- **Proof of Activity (PoAT):** Validates *what* you do (verifiable effort, human contribution, or IoT-recorded activity).  

Together, they create a **status-activity fusion model** secured by **AI Elder Agents**. Unlike PoW or PoS, DRP consensus is **human-centric, contribution-driven, and AI-verified**.

## 2. Consensus Workflow  

1. **Transaction Submission**  
   - User submits transaction with embedded PoST and PoAT proofs.  
   - Examples: school ID verification, IoT sensor logging, app-tracked activity.  

2. **Local Validation**  
   - PoST checked via DID/VC (Decentralized Identity / Verifiable Credential).  
   - PoAT validated using IoT logs, app attestations, or ZK-proofs.  

3. **Quorum Formation**  
   - Elder Agents form a quorum (`m-of-n`).  
   - Each Elder signs the block after verifying validity.  

4. **Block Finalization**  
   - Block header includes:  
     - Previous hash  
     - Merkle root  
     - PoST attestations  
     - PoAT proofs  
     - Elder quorum signature  

   - Once quorum threshold is met, block is finalized.

## 3. Block Structure  

BlockHeader {
previous_hash
merkle_root
timestamp
status_attestations (PoST)
activity_proofs (PoAT)
elder_quorum_signature
}

## 4. Consensus Security  

- **Sybil Resistance:** PoST ensures unique, verified identities.  
- **Fairness:** Prevents plutocracy (like PoS) and centralization of wealth.  
- **Energy Efficiency:** No wasteful computation like PoW.  
- **AI Oversight:** Detects fraudulent activity and adversarial inputs.  
- **Revocation Mechanism:** Compromised Elders are removed via Elder Revocation Lists (ERLs).  

---

## 5. Mathematical Foundations  

**Quorum Requirement:**  

\[
Q \geq \frac{2n}{3}
\]

Where \( Q \) = quorum signatures, \( n \) = number of Elders.  

**Fusion Weight Function:**  

\[
C = \alpha \cdot S + \beta \cdot A
\]

- \( S \) = Proof of Status score  
- \( A \) = Proof of Activity score  
- \( \alpha, \beta \) = adjustable weights (policy defined)  

Block is valid if:  

\[
C \geq \theta
\]

Where \( \theta \) = consensus threshold.

## 6. Comparison with Existing Consensus  

| Feature            | PoW (Bitcoin) | PoS (Ethereum) | PoST + PoAT (DRP) |
|--------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Resource Basis     | Hashpower     | Wealth         | Identity + Effort |
| Energy Efficiency  | ❌ Wasteful    | ⚡ Efficient    | ⚡ Efficient |
| Human-Centric      | ❌ No          | ❌ Limited      | ✅ Yes |
| AI-Verified        | ❌ No          | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes |
| Plutocracy Risk    | ❌ No          | ⚠️ Yes          | ✅ Mitigated |
| Real-World Utility | ❌ Low         | ⚠️ Medium       | ✅ High |

## 7. Future Extensions  

- **Federated AI Elders:** Distributed training of Elder models across nodes.  
- **Post-Quantum Security:** Lattice-based signatures (Dilithium, Falcon).  
- **Dynamic Weighting:** Adjust PoST vs PoAT weights per sector (healthcare, education, sustainability).  
- **Cross-Chain Consensus:** Extend PoST + PoAT proofs into other ecosystems (Ethereum, Polkadot).  

---

## 8. Conclusion  
The DRP consensus model is **a world-first fusion of human rights and technical verification**. It shifts consensus away from raw computational power or financial stake, toward **identity, contribution, and fairness — verified by AI**.  

This ensures DRP is not just another blockchain, but a **new trust layer for humanity.**
